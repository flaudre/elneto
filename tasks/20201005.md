    Done, take "Manage Galeries", "Manage Yonny En Fotos", "Manage Poems" effect

- [ ] The entry pages for Yonny are too empty at the top. It would be nice if one could see more of his paintings (or texts or fotos of him). So my suggestion would be to put the title YONNY and the two lines of text to the left of the three fotos of him, so the paintings move up a bit.

- [ ] Something that should work, actually is not working: the three links in the upper right corner (toggle full screen, download or share, and close) work fine in all the other sections, but they are inactive in the pictures of yonny

- [ ] In the section "sus poemas", there is just one level of texts now. I would like to have a structure of two levels there. For example, Yonny wrote many short poems in the style of japanese Haikus. So when I open the page "sus poemas" I don't want to see all the twenty haikus, but just the title of the collection: "haikus". And only when I go to that title, the individual titles of the different poems drop down. Do you understand what I mean?

- [ ] I really like the layout of the pictures in Yonny "sus cuadros", and that you can move them. But they shouldn't repeat themselves. In the top row (title: diarios-ripios-diarios), it looks now as if there were many pictures, but there are only 4. So is it possible, that we only see 4?

- [ ] When I click on one of the pictures to see it bigger, is it possible to move from that to the next one directly, with an arrow, as is the case with the theater pictures? So I wouldn't have to go back to the entire list of paintings and then open again.
